1. Clone the repo.
1. `cd` into `lib`.

### Reminder
If you want this application in your Github account, make sure to remove the `.git` and initalize and link to a new repo under your account.
Please work on implementing the same functionality for the monuments:
1. Get all monuments from API.
2. Display all monuments on DOM in a new section below the section for national parks.
3. Each monument should have a delete button, which when clicked, removes the monument from the API.
